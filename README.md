<h1>FLIP NINJA</h1>
<h2>Developed by Arfaa Mumtaz for CMPT 230</h2>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>'Flip Ninja' revolves around a ninja that runs endlessly to no set destination, avoiding obstacles in his path, aiming to get farther than he did last time. His special ability is his control over the force of gravity. He can seamlessly change the way gravity around him functions, solely for his own convenience because this allows him to manage his trajectory and squeeze through the gaps in trees easier.</p>
